-- | Converts an 'Expression' into a 'Polynomial'.
-- 'Nothing' will be returned if the conversion is not possible.
--
-- Specify the symbol representing the variable for the polynomial with 'forVariable'.
-- For example,
--
-- >>> fromExpression (forVariable "x") (("x" + 4) ** 3) :: Maybe IndexedPolynomial
-- Just x^3 + 12x^2 + 48x + 64
--
-- By default, symbols other than the variable for the polynomial are not allowed.
-- To use symbols representing constants, use 'withSymbolicCoefficients' as well.
-- Note that the polynomial type the expression is being converted into
-- must be able to handle symbolic mathematical expressions for the coefficients.
-- For example,
--
-- >>> let expr = ("a" + "b") * "x" + "c" :: Expression
-- >>> let (Just p) = fromExpression (withSymbolicCoefficients (forVariable "x")) expr :: Maybe IndexedSymbolicPolynomial
-- >>> toHaskell $ simplify $ coefficient p 1
-- "a + b"
--
-- The expressions which can be converted must only use 'negate', '(+)', '(*)', '(-)',
-- '(/)' with only numbers, coefficients which do not contain the variable,
-- '(**)' with a non-negative integral exponent, and expressions formed thereof.
