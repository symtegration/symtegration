-- This merges numeric terms as much as it can to simplify expressions.
-- Simplifications are finitely equivalent; i.e., any calculation with
-- finite inputs should result in the equivalent finite input.
-- The changes will also be exact, and no numeric constant will be replaced
-- by an approximate floating-point number.

-- | Simplifies computations involving numeric constants.

-- "5"
-- >>> toHaskell $ simplify $ 8 ** (1/3)

-- It will replace subtraction by addition and square roots by powers of \(\frac{1}{2}\).
